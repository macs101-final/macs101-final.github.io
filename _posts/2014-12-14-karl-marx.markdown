<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">K</span>arl Marx was born on 5 May 1818 in the kingdom of prussia. Marx was ancestrally Jewish. Karl's father, as a child known as Herschel, was the first in the line to receive a secular education. In October 1835 at the age of 17, Marx travelled to the University of Bonn wishing to study philosophy and literature; however, his father insisted on law as a more practical field. After going to the university, Karl Marx became interested in society, economics, and politics. His theories on these subjects are collectively understood as Marxism. His most famous work is the 1848 pamphlet <i>The Communist Manifesto</i></p>


<p>Although today Marx is popularly recognized as the creator of communism, his criticism towards political economic was the one that is important in Media Studies. As there was a shift from feudalism to capitalism due to the idea that human labor could be traded as commodity, Marx believed that labor was underpaid. The difference in value is what makes capitalism work. Thus, this would lead to exploitation of labor.</p>

<p>As of his theories regarding social class, Marx proposed that capitalist society was divided into two general classes of people: The capitalist class, owns and controls the means of production and the working class, which provides wage labor for capitalists. Marx suggested this class framework would lead to increase in disparity between the two social class. On one hand, the capitalist class would get richer due to the surplus of value, on the other hand, the working class would become poorer because These workers and their families had almost no access to educational institutions.</p>

<p>As of how Marx's critique of capitalism is especially important for Media Studies,  He believed that the organization of a society's economic system largely decides its major institutions. He proposed elements such as educational curricula and schools; political ideas and the structure of the government; and the content of scientific, journalistic, and artistic texts, are primarily shaped by the capitalist system of production. Marx argued that the institutions of society serve to reinforce the capitalist class control. In a nutshell, the ideas and representations that circulate in the mass media are confined to those that the capitalist class finds acceptable. </p>
