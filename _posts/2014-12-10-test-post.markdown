<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the mid-twentieth century, a group of scholars now known as The Frankfurt School drew on the ideas of Marx, among other theorists, in their social analysis.The Frankfurt School's members were especially worried that the structure of twentieth century society relied too heavily on the empirical sciences and the belief that the natural world could be completely known and mastered.</p>

Markx and other members of Franfurt School were concerned about the use of mass communication technology in distributing media content.

They refer this process as Culture Industry.

They were afraid that this technology/process would lead to a distorted and dangerous approach of social control. Again, this refers to the idea of having the capitalist class controls and owns the production of media/information.

However, this idea is not well adopted due to the fact that technology actually empowers artists to produce and distribute their content idependently.

For instance, soundcloud allows musicians to upload their content and allow millions of listeners to stream their music. This is something that was not possible before the raise of technology, especially mass communication.
